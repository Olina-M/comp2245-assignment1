 <h2>Olina Marie</h2>
 <p>I go by the name Olina Marie, and I'm 22 years old, currently pursuing my studies as a Level 2 student at the University of the West Indies. In my free time, I find immense pleasure in binge-watching crime and medical series. My long-term aspiration is to establish a prominent presence within the Information Technology field. Although programming isn't my forte, I'm gradually improving my skills in this area. Furthermore, I hold the position of Public Relations Officer for the SOSCAI (School of Science, Computing, and Artificial Intelligence) committee, mainly because I've discovered a passion for public speaking and overseeing the approval of advertising designs. Web development interests me due to its capacity to transform concepts into interesting and dynamic digital encounters. It serves as a conduit for expanding my proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various programming languages, enabling me to remain current with cutting-edge technologies and grasp their functionalities.</p>
