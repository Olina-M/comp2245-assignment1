 <h2>Olina Marie</h2>
 <p>I go by the name Olina Marie, and I'm 22 years old, currently pursuing my studies as a Level 2 student at the University of the West Indies. In my free time, I find immense pleasure in binge-watching crime and medical series. My long-term aspiration is to establish a prominent presence within the Information Technology field. Although programming isn't my forte, I'm gradually improving my skills in this area. Furthermore, I hold the position of Public Relations Officer for the SOSCAI (School of Science, Computing, and Artificial Intelligence) committee, mainly because I've discovered a passion for public speaking and overseeing the approval of advertising designs. </p>
